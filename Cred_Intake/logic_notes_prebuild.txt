okay so they changed the format of the workbooks were importing... ughh
So now instead of different sheets they just have everything on one sheet with different tables for each category


Now the way they have it set up is that they have the tables headers from column A to AJ & downward...
but once they list all the records/rows for a category they then fckn create a new table with the same headers for a different category..
The category type is found under the header 'STATUS' and wel see things like 'INITIAL', 'RECRED', 'HDO' OR 'HDO-INTIIAL' OR 'HDO-RECRED', 'REINSTATEMENT', 'LINK-RECRED' OR 'LINK-INTIIAL'


So here are the headers from the sheet:

Accountable Health Care  
Allied Pacific of California
All American Medical Group
Alpha Care Medical Group  
American Acupuncture Chinese Medicine
Associated Hispanic Physicians
Arroyo Vista Family Health Clinic

Now i want to follow the same logic from the script we built before its basically the same data they just messed with the damned structure... 
So now we need to be able to recognize when a new category table starts and where it ends and where the other begins... get me?


So these ppl created the tables like this (trying to explain it as best as possible structure wise)
So lets assume that on Row 1 and Column A
Title (for the whole log) (meaningless to us)
Category Title(usually Initials, Recred, Re-instatements(+ a wordsalad on unneccessary letters, meaningless to us. We only care about the Reinstatement word), HDO or HDOs (same thing), Link
Headers (which i gave you above)
Usually a list of providers 
Then once we hit an empty row that means that this table has ended and usually theres a couple more empty rows before the next table starts (sigh... smh i know bruh i know...)


So basically just like before the goal is to split this into separate work books in a smart way - you know build our own headers and pull the same data we wanted like how we did it master5.py


So what you think? can we pull this off?
